# Asyncio
Just try to make asyncio more human and provide some real-life examples of asyncio

*_fib.py: examples of the same fibonacci algorythm being excecuted with threads, multiprocessing or asyncio.
*_coffee.py: showing how to get input while some long process is being executed.

You can mangle the asyncio ones just to test that a blocking task will make other cooperative tasks to not get executed.
